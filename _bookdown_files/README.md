> "In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus \(/ˈdʒeɪnəs/; Latin: IANVS \(Iānus\), pronounced \[ˈjaː.nus\]\) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways,\[1\] passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past." from Wikipedia, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus), accessed 27 November, 2018 at 4:17PM
