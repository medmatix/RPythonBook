# A Comparative Look



As already mentioned, it is not the intent of this treatise to teach either beginning R or python scripting. There are many good sources for this and yet another beginners book or tutorial is, I believe, not needed. For ease of reference I include  [Appendix1](https://github.com/medmatix/RtoPythonThoughts/blob/master/Appendix_1.md) as an overview of relevant R and python syntax for the general programming constructs any functional language. In Part 1, at the risk of being pedantic, I am simply giviing a fairly generic overview of the components of the typical script or program as a framework to be used in organizing our R and Python comparisons.

## Functional Programming Commonalities.

In functional programming operational code is incorporated by task and purpose into blocks of code which are called by name in the body of a script. This usually includes some connecting statemts and assignments which cause the functions to operate together to accomplish some larger task.

Historically, Fortran and Basic code in common accademic and educational use, became unwieldy as users became, more and more, writers of rampant spagetti code.The introduction of the concept of 'structured programming' and the uniform reliance on subroutine and function call tamed the spagetti-monster. Extension to functional programming with pascal and modern C was a natural extension of this trend.

So the reliance of R and Python on script collections of functions calling each other is what we are at now. Functions are subprograms that have all the statement tasks common to most programs. I will deal in a general way with these statement types and include comparsions between how R and Python each express the tasks. It is not the intent of this book to actually teach beginning programming as previously mentioned. Consult the bibliography for some suggested sources for peginning programmers.

The later innovation of object oriented programming concepts evolving from this will be touched on in a comparative fashion in another chapter.

### Statements and Expressions

A program or script is of course considered as a series of statement stored together. These statements constitute expressions of mathemetical equations (see specifically [Chapter 5]()), choices, and other orders to be carried out by the machine. 

With any program or script statements tasks and values stored are executed or accessed from memory locations. This was the innovation conceived of by John Von Neumann which moved programming from the moving wire jumpers to the input to the machine from various codes punched into tapes or cards to be held in memory while being used.

### Assignment of Values to Memory and the Variable

Variables are memory locations assigned values as the computing process goes on. The classification of specific locations determines a type of data held there.

The codes stored in the machine include a specific operator code to direct the move of a value received for input or a statement's result to a memory location. This is called and assignment. 

Traditionally R has used the combined dash-less-than symbols ' -> ' for this purpose but the simple equals sign ' = ' now also works in this fashion. Python uses the same equals sign for assignments.

Variables are named in both R and Python and neither may begin with a digit. There are other restrictions and conventions which are not gone into here. 


### Decisions and Choices

As currently implemented all choices by a computer resolve to yes or no results. Some semblance or the greys we think in are a result of a collection or range of yes-no questions. These choices are explicit of implicit 'if' queries.

### Doing it Over Again (and again ...)

Loops are created within a program logic, usually involving a choice test to be executed which cause tasks to be repeated zero or more times. It is considered bad parctice to create a loop without some form of exit (short of having to power down the machine).

### Functions 

Functions in fortran were short program clips that did a task and immediately returned a value . Subroutines are more like what functions in R and Python are, though returning to the calling place with some value is a frequent option with these functions as well. Functions may provide a new programming element like a square root (python, math.sqrt(x)) extending the language, or functions may carry out a whole task like carring out a liner regression, storing objects of the answer in memory for retrieval, or return as an object explicitly. Ofter a function is called that builds a whole grphic plot for display or other output when called.

In R,

```
function.name <- function(arguments) 
{
  computations on the arguments
  maybe other code too
}
```

and in Python indents take the place of brackets to define code blocks. Self in the function spec is the calling code block, and if omitted, is created by python implicitly. So, your first argument one way of another is the calling namespace. Self in the indented code block is the function itself.

```
def aroutine(self, args)
  computations on args
  maybe other code too
```

The notation of R is C (and Java) - like and Python is Pascal-like in format. Unlike pascal there is no 'begin:' keyword required at anytime in the script. 

Functional programming with R and Python, will be expanded on in it's own chapter later on.

### Objects and Classes

In general terms we will come to consider all program elements as objects. A Class will be considered as a pattern definition for an object. All objects are used as instances of some previously defined class.
