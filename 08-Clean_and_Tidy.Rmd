# Clean and Tidy Data 

\index{cleaning data} \index{tidy data}
In an ideal world all data would come organized and in an immediatelyt usable form. Of course, such is unlikely. Datasets are missing values, in the wrong datatype for use, have misleading correlations, such as with time data, and so on. Both R and prython have library and builting functions to clean and tidy or data in a documented reproducible way before proceeding with our studies on it.
