He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past.” from Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus, accessed 27 November, 2018 at 4:17PM 1.2 Preface This book is a work in progress on the thoughts of an R programmer (the author) moving to (or learning) Python. It is intended as a comparison of R and Python for those already using R. The hop is to ease the way for those in particular newer to programming as opposed to the quick task oriented scripting which R lends itself so well to. As with any language the most visible presence on line are the hardened champions of the languages with the pressure to standardization (not a bad thing per-se) and dogmatic adherence to the “blah blah” way of doing things (which is less desirable I think). For those of us who are not playing at being computer scientist but just scientists with a need for tools to do our work mose effectively an approachable treatment of scripting and programming is helpful. There are better computer science texts and better programming texts than this book would ever purport to be. I will often be reminding the reader that this is not a beginning programming book. Neither is it a Computer Science text book. It is a book by a applied programmers for applied programmers who operate in other research domains. Having started as an R user, then as an R programmer, I have relatively recently embarked on learning python as well. Why I would do this is rather complicated to explain, particularly as I had knowledge of other general programming languages, which would conceivably serve such a role, particularly BASIC and Java. Suffice to say that as a budding Data Scientist I see lots of reasons to know both R and Python. BASIC, though still extant it is very limited in support and relevant libraries by comparison. Java . . . well, as a strong open source advocate I feel Java is bound to Oracle in many ways for all time. It is likely they have no intention of truly releasing it into the public domain, ever. There is far more rationel to learn C++ these days than Java for the sake of what is arguably only minor difference in learning curve. I absolutely love R! When I returned to school to study Applied Math and Statistics it was an ever present partner for me. It could do most things I needed, though matrix math was less smooth than Matlab the price was right (not withstanding Octave or Scilab). However, I increasingly found the need for a general purpose programming language and Python was there growing in the guise of ‘the’ data science alternative. But while R was great with vectorized functions python, at it’s core, was weak in this regard. The libraries for python have been growing steadily in number and variety, and the functionality gap between it and R narrows in cluding for vectorized application. I still cannot see a Data Scientist being as productive not knowing R at this point. However, I see no reason not to also know Python - ergo, I think any serious Data Science needs to know both; AND, there is the added incentive of the interoperability of R and Python (and C++)! From R we have XRPython and reticulate and from Python we have Rpy2. There are far more choices for languages to do Data Science with than I am dealing with here. Arguably, at time point, R and Python seem the most suitable overall to “out of the gate” data analysis. Julia is comming on strong, and C++ is everyones speed oriented fall back. However speed is loosing place in the decision criteria as benchmark comparisons increasingly are show. Most new packages are written in C or C++ anyway and Cython makes this fairly approachable for python package developers. Bottlenecks in Big Data analysis are rarely CPU limited where out of RAM processing, large files and disk access become the limiting factors. The Organization of the book is in 3 parts. A close Comparison and discussion of R and Python unburdened by a mandate to comprehensively teach beginning programming in either. The first is the overviews of part 1, I only touch quite generally on the nature of the usual The procedural elements of programming structures, Variables, datatypes and data structures, binary decisions, repeating code blocks are all internals in declarative or functional programming - they are just details. The Same can be said for languages introducing object-oriented programming models. In the second part of the book, an opportunity is taken to compare how data science can be done in R and Python in some of the various domains we work. The distinction between function and object is quite blurred here. In part 3, a collection of syntax summaries, library reference materials and resources are compiled in Appendices. In a sense one could consider this book as a second or third source for applied R users learning python - perhaps after the beginner and intermediate level courses to get the necessary python syntax vocabulary and programming structures.

["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction This is not a book on learning to program with R or python. Consider it the companion for non-programmers who are learning python with some knowledge of R. Learning a new programming or scripting language begs comparison. Often this is not overly helpful to the learner who, coming from a zone of comfort is often frustrated by the old subtleties not consciously recognized, being yet unknown in the new. I recall a family member, completely new to computers, saying why doesn’t it know what I mean expecting the implied parts of language to transfer from English (or German, or Chinese etc.) to computer language. R writers early on recognize the absence of vectorization of functions in core python. It’s available though in numpy and pandas, but base python doesn’t have it and they miss it. You’ll get there, really. Object Orientation is also not natural to either R or Python. It came later to both, but it seems more smoothly accomplished by python than R. I soon realized, though that you had to know the programming commonalities of python first; R comparisons really should start with the libraries of python. R in someways has cut right to the data science chase often at the expense of strong programming constructs. This is the nod to interactive coding and scripting rather than the need to undertake formal programming. Python began early on with a scripting functionality but it wasn’t until the development of iPython that interactive python could be realized in the way that R users were used to. All this is not to say that R was lacking in basic programming constructs from the start, it wasn’t; but the proportion of users who used R in a quick-and-dirty small problem focused way was quite high. This suited it’s use as a learning environment for introductory statistics7. I should think that those who try to start python at the same time as their first statistics course will find the learning curve too steep to help with their need to learn statistics. Dalgaard7 was the first source I used to learn R during my second semester of Statistics. I similarly used Lutz8 to learn Python well after I was comfortable with R and Probability and Statistics. One needs to get past the programming knowledge of python to affectively get up to speed with matrix algebra, probability and statistics and data munging using the available libraries outside of the basic and Standard Library2 functions of python. There are books to help you cut some corners in applying python to data science9, 10, but it’s very easy to find oneself confused without a good level of comfort with the ideas and the pitfalls of importing modules in python. Namespaces and variable visibility are less forgiving in python than R. Once you get comfortable with the math and stats functions available in numpy and/or scipy modules, the data structures and munging functions of Panda and the grphics and plotting functions of Matplotlib you are up to the speed you had gotten to much earlier with R. As a final word, it may seem like I distain style, in favor of substance. I recall in a list of interview questions somewhere whether software that worked was more important than well documented code or vis-a-versa. It is a trick question. Though software that doesn’t work is useless, it may be worse if it is unfixable too. You can’t debug what is not understandable and spagetti code that is undocumented and disappearing into thin air never to be seen again is impossible to work on. Not only will others who want to adapt or debug our old code be lost, but given a month away from it, we probably won’t know whatwe mwere doing either. Comment obscessively from the start. There is a plethora of free open source code and applications out there. Poor documention for users is lazy and sloppy and betrays our responsibility to tell our clients how to use the solutions we offer. Sometimes those clients are us and we deserve better too. Writing user documentation helps us think about our projects in a new perspective - making our work more valuable. Reproducibility is a necessity for any modern endeavor. In the face of the reseach fraud resurfacing more and more, we can no longer ask people to “just trust us”. Data Scientists must know this from the outset. markdown with integrated code, Rstudio and Jupyter addresses this issue superbly well and so their use is central to what I am writing. The fact that they allow multi-language processing in the documents is the bonus. See the References and Resources at the end of the book for other books and articles on Documentation, Style and Reproducibility. So now we can forge ahead and look at R and python side-by-side and perhaps reduce the learning curve for python Data Science libraries. "],
["a-comparative-look.html", "3 A Comparative Look 3.1 Functional Programming Commonalities. 3.2 Building Blocks of Functions as Procedures", " 3 A Comparative Look As already mentioned, it is not the intent of this treatise to teach either beginning R or python scripting. There are many good sources for this and yet another beginners book or tutorial I believe is not needed. For ease of reference, I include in the Appendix1 an overview of relevant R and python syntax and the general programming constructs common to any functional language. In Part 1, at the risk of being pedantic, I am giving a generic overview of the components of the typical script or program to be used as a framework in organizing our R and Python comparisons. 3.1 Functional Programming Commonalities. In functional programming, a kind of declarative paradigm, operational code is incorporated by task and purpose into blocks of code which are called by name in the body of a script. In practice it is most often a hybride rather than any one pure paradigm incolved. As a result some connecting statements and assignments in the program of script set up a milieu in which the functions operate together to accomplish some larger task. Historically, Fortran and Basic code in common academic and educational use, became unwieldy as users became increasingly prone to the writing of rampant spagetti code. The introduction of the concept of ‘structured programming’ and the uniform reliance on subroutine and function calls mostly tamed the spagetti-monster within a procedural programming paradigm. Growth of functional programming with pascal and to some extent modern C was a natural evolution of this trend and object oriented extensions to most legacy languages exist as we’ll see later on. So the perspective of R and Python as relying on script collections of functions calling each other is what we are stressing now. Purely Functional programs use functions and flow is linear through the collection which makes up the program. In a strict sense this would be done without regard to flow control, but functions are just in a sense subprograms with all the statements of procedural tasks and flow control within, common to the usual conception of programs. I will deal, in a general way with the, statement types which make up the functions and include comparsions between how R and Python each express the tasks. As I’ve already stressed,this book not aimed at teaching beginning programming. Consult the bibliography for some suggested sources for beginning programmers^7, 8^. The later innovation of object oriented programming concepts evolving from this will be touched on in a comparative fashion in another chapter. 3.2 Building Blocks of Functions as Procedures 3.2.1 Statements and Expressions A program or script is of course considered as a series of instructions grouped together and run as a unit. These statements constitute expressions of mathemetical equations (see specifically Chapter 5), choices, and other orders to be carried out by the machine. With any program or script statements tasks and values stored are executed or accessed from memory locations. This was the innovation conceived of by John Von Neumann which moved programming from the moving wire jumpers to the input to the machine from various codes punched into tapes or cards to be held in memory while being used. 3.2.2 Assignment of Values to Memory and the Variable Variables are memory locations assigned values as the computing process goes on. The classification of specific locations determines a type of data held there. The codes stored in the machine include a specific operator code to direct the move of a value received for input or a statement’s result to a memory location. This is called and assignment. Traditionally R has used the combined dash-less-than symbols ‘-&gt;’ for this purpose but the simple equals sign ‘=’ now also works in this fashion. Python uses the same equals sign for assignments. Variables are named in both R and Python and neither may begin with a digit. There are other restrictions and conventions which are not gone into here. 3.2.3 Decisions and Choices As currently implemented all choices by a computer resolve to yes or no results. Some semblance or the greys we think in are a result of a collection or range of yes-no questions. These choices are explicit or implicit ‘if’ queries. 3.2.4 Doing it Over Again (and again …) Loops are created within a program logic, usually involving a choice test to be executed which cause tasks to be repeated zero or more times. It is considered bad parctice to create a loop without some form of exit (short of having to power down the machine). 3.2.5 Functions Functions in fortran were short program clips that did a task and immediately returned a value . Subroutines are more like what functions in R and Python are, though returning to the calling place with some value is a frequent option with these functions as well. Functions may provide a new programming element like a square root (python, math.sqrt(x)) extending the language, or functions may carry out a whole task like carring out a liner regression, storing objects of the answer in memory for retrieval, or return as an object explicitly. Often a function is called that builds a whole graphic plot for display or other output when called. In R, function.name &lt;- function(arguments) { computations on the arguments maybe other code too } and in Python indents take the place of brackets to define code blocks. Self in the function spec is the calling code block, and if omitted, is created by python implicitly. In the functional paradigm, self is always present but implicitly. It becomes important in object-oriented programming in python where, your first argument implicitly or explicitly is the calling namespace. ‘Self’ in the indented code block would be the function itself. def aroutine(args): computations on args maybe other code too The notation of R is C (and Java) - like with bracketed blocks, and Python is Pascal-like with indented blocks. Unlike pascal there is no ‘begin:’ keyword required to start the script but when named code blocks are used such as functions the colon is needed at the end of definition. Functional programming with R and Python, will be expanded on in Chapter 6 later on. 3.2.6 Objects and Classes anticipating Object-Oriented Programming In general terms we will come to consider all program elements as objects. A Class will be considered as a pattern definition for an object in the same fashion as a function definition. All objects are used as instances of some previously defined class created by an assignment statement. AnInstance=ClassName() # call ClassName constructor to create an instance &quot;AnInstance&quot; More later in Chapter 12 "],
["set-up-for-r-and-python-exercises.html", "4 Set-up for R and Python Exercises 4.1 Package Libraries 4.2 Pulling it Together 4.3 Using R and Python Together", " 4 Set-up for R and Python Exercises Clearly you have to get R and python onto your system. I have a bias about dependance on any en block installed software stacks, like Anaconda etc. Anaconda is a convenient way to install programs together. However it is easy to loose locations of programs and tools and have conflicts with installs from outside of the group installers, such as different Python destributions, and difficult to manage path complexity. Just the same, Anaconda is a good choice if you are doing a clean install and intend to do everthing inside that framework.Then installing Anaconda,Python Data Science Platform can make things much easier in the long run for integrating R and Python and Reproducible Research work. All of these sites will help you approach installs and configurations in a variety of ways. As an R programmer, first I installed R, then RStudio4. Once installed, RStudio is a convenient way to install the R packages as well. Then I installed Python 3 from Python Software Foundation. From that point on I used PIP package manager for python and RGUI for package installs for python and R respectively and install jupyter see Project Jupyter. This gave the maximum flexibility for R and Python in their own environments. I also installed the SciPy (which includes numpy), Pandas, and Matplotlib all using PIP. I did do a parallel Anaconda install afterwards with R and RStudio and iPython for Jupyter Notebooks but as mentioned there was some path confusion with this approach. It does set you up nicely for any approach to data science and development you could choose down the road. You really are going to need an IDE for Python. Spyder, available separately installed with PIP, or installed through Anaconda. It is a solid python focused choice. I personally use Eclipse as it is open sourced and you can use it for multiple languages including R (not as strong yet) and python, HTML/CSS/javascript, C/C++, Java and others. 4.1 Package Libraries The strength of both R and Python is from their libraries. CRAN Package Repository and Bioconnector are both well stocked with general and special purposed functions for R. RStudio develops R Packages integrating well with the RStudio environment. The are lost of R packages in development awaiting addition to CRAN or hosted outside of CRAN such as on Github. If the reader has spent any time with R at all you have likely made inroads into these package sources. So how does Python compare? Python comes with a large standard library providing “out of the gate” functionality to compare with R-core. The best handing of the intricacies of the python standard library I’ve found is Doug Helmann’s The Python 3 Standard Library by example. Python Software foundation hosts the Python Package Index , PyPi analygous to the CRAN repositories and Bioconnector. Also, the most important resource to get you up to speed is SciPy tools consisting of SciPy, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. These are the essential minimum to do any R-like work in python. These and more can be accessed as well through the Numfocus Projects. Finally, you should check out the StatsModels11 package site. 4.2 Pulling it Together Having apprised ourselves of the breadth and availability of these resources we will go forward and organize some of the ideas. R packages can be installed with the R GUI but the RStudio environment is much easier for this. Once a package is installed it is available in all environments I’ve alluded to. Compiling and installing is always best and I thing RStudio makes this fairly painless. Remember to start the GUI, Anaconda or RStudio environment as administrator to keep things together. 4.2.1 The Prompts When accessing the R and Python interpreters from the command shell (or bash) prompt, $ after the version and copyright banners, if present, you are at an interpreter prompt. For R this is: &gt; for python, &gt;&gt;&gt; for iPython In [1]: from this point you enter what ever commands or statements you wish to execute. These are executed immediately, or continued with continuation prompts until executable. Once executed any declarations and output are retained if the were assigned to some object to be held in memory. Immediate answers are generally lost. Otherwise, one groups statements into a file to be read all at once and executed as a group. Objects created are again retained in memory by default. This is a script of program. Script file extensions are standardized for the operating system to recognize, eg.(.R for R, and .py or pyc for python). Python scripts intended to be called by other scripts for library code to be incorporated are called modules and end in the same .py extension. A package can be considered, in both R and python) as a collection of declarations, functions, classes, or modules for library purposes. 4.2.2 Installing Packages From the R GUI prompt we have, package-install() Python packages from any source mentioned above can be installed with the PIP utility. This can be done from the shell prompt (remember to start as administrator or root): $ pip install matplotlib # OR $ python -m pip install matplotlib This can be done as root with the anaconda prompt as well. 4.2.3 Using Packages In R we must make sure the package (once installed) is loaded for our session. This is done with the library() function, library(&quot;reticulate&quot;) while in python we import the package previously installed as, import numpy Once imported or loaded into either, we can access the functions of reticulate directly by name. If we have a previous function of the same name it gets overwritten unless in python we keep the name spaces separate. This can be done by the form of the import statement. We can also import only slected functions from a package module. import numpy as np # usual format to use namespace segregation of functions from numpy import sum, matrix # economical import,still can conflict without renaming # using &#39;as&#39;, such as where base python has a sum() # function and math has a different one called sum() 4.3 Using R and Python Together There are several ways that one could find helpful to use R and Python together, to take best advantage of their respective strengths 4.3.1 Working in R and Calling Python In this instance one would find working in R the necessary starting place and find the need to employ python functions or packages helpful to your needs. A call would be made to the python function from R to have a task completed by python and control returned to the R program. cat(&quot;PI in R is&quot;, pi) ## PI in R is 3.141593 import math print(math.pi) ## 3.141592653589793 4.3.2 Working in Python and Calling R Working in python and calling an R object would look like, # Accessing an R object from from python # (example from: http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-dev/html/introduction.html) import rpy2.robjects as robjects rpi = robjects.r[&#39;pi&#39;] print(&quot;PI from R = &quot;, rpi) 4.3.3 Working in Jupyter and Writing in R, Python or Both in the Same Notebook There are multiple kernel plugins available for jupyter notebooks. As A rule, the notebooks only use one language kernel at a time. An exception is the [SOS kernel](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/. Jupyter is running first level in python. It is afterall a python module. When running the R kernel (irkernel) remmber you are running R in python. See the caution below in the contest of rMarkdown code chunks. Consider this Jupyter notebook using the R kernel, Jupyter R Demo and this Jupyter notebook using the ‘Python kernel’, Jupyter Python Demo 4.3.4 Working in rmarkdown and Using R and Python Code Chunks Now consider an rmarkdown session running primarily in R. The T code chunks are executed in the same R session as the rMarkdown. On the otherhand, a python code chunk is running in a python guest environment in the R level host. Caution: I have found behavior is unpredictible to call R objects back with Python chunks run in rmarkdown (ie. inside another instance of R). The identity of R_User for rpy2 gets lost. There are limits to how deeply you should nest languages within languages. That said, the rmarkdown chunks look like this. &#39;&#39;&#39;{r} cat(&quot;PI in R is&quot;, pi) &#39;&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;&#39;{python} import math print(math.pi) &#39;&#39;&#39; "],
["basic-mathematics-in-r-and-python.html", "5 Basic Mathematics in R and Python 5.1 Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide 5.2 Other basic algebraic operators in R and Python", " 5 Basic Mathematics in R and Python This is pretty straight forward and intuitive stuff. Just the same, for completeness here it is. The Standard libraries of python have the function beyond the four arithmetic operations. 5.1 Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide The usual quick calculation would be done in immediate or interactive mode without relying on print statements. There is outwardly no difference if the print is used as would be the case in a script. However Printing a set of values reqires the set be organized into an object in itself, a vector. # Loading reticulate package to bring python interpreter on line. library(&quot;reticulate&quot;) 5.1.1 R Scripting # Some immediate calculations, ie. using R like a calculator 2 + 3 # (simple interactive) addition ## [1] 5 5 - 2 # subtraction ## [1] 3 6 * 2 # multiplication ## [1] 12 4 / 3 # division ## [1] 1.333333 print(4 / 3) # calculation in a script requires print to display an answer ## [1] 1.333333 # Variable assignment and printing grouped variables as a vector a &lt;- (2 + 3) # addition b &lt;- (5 - 2) # subtraction c &lt;- (6 * 2) # multiplication d &lt;- (4 / 3) # division print (c(a, b, c, d)) # printing all results together one statement ## [1] 5.000000 3.000000 12.000000 1.333333 Python, on the otherhand considers literal expressions and variables individually (though we’ll see they can be groups as well.) This thr puthon print statement is by default printing one or more individual objects as scalars whereas R print function prints object and there is no scalar. The simplest object in R is the vector. 5.1.2 Python Scripting The simplest object in python is the scalar, having one of five basic datatypes, Integers Floating-Point Numbers Complex Numbers Strings Boolean Type # The same immediate calculations, ie. using iPython like a calculator print(2 + 5, 3 * 8, 5 - 1, 67 / 3) # printing all immediate results together, one statement ## 7 24 4 22.333333333333332 # OR assignment and print a = 2 + 5 # assigned addition b = 5 - 1 # assigned subtraction c = 3 * 8 # assigned multiplication d = 67 / 3 # assigned division print(a,b,c,d) # printing all results together one statement ## 7 4 24 22.333333333333332 print(&#39;a =&#39;, a, &#39;b =&#39;,b, &#39;c =&#39;,c, &#39;d =&#39;,d) # annotating print is just using 4 literals and 4 variables ## a = 7 b = 4 c = 24 d = 22.333333333333332 This differs from R where a single object is printed but that object may be a group of objects combined. 5.2 Other basic algebraic operators in R and Python Next lets compare modulus, powers and interger division in R and python, 35 %% 2 # modulo operator ## [1] 1 35 %/% 2 # integer division ## [1] 17 35^2 # powers in R\\ ## [1] 1225 print(35%2) # modulo operator ## 1 print(35 // 2) # integer division * note difference from R ## 17 print(35**2) # powers in python * note difference from R ## 1225 Note here with python the print statements are required otherwise only the last immediate calculation would get output to text. When we extend our algebraic calculations in R the usual functions of square root, absolute value and exponentiation we still haven’t had to load any library packages. All these are part of the core R. abs(-5) # absolute value ## [1] 5 sqrt(16) # square root function ## [1] 4 exp(0) # exponent (e^0 etc) ## [1] 1 Not necessarily so for python. We still have the basic functions for algebraic tasks but from sqrt on ward, we now need to go to the standard math library for these. As an aside we could have got more powerful versions of these functions (and more) importing numpy or numba or scipy library packages. This will come up in more detail later. print(abs(-5)) ## 5 print(divmod(10,3)) # Returns quotient and remainder of integer division ## (3, 1) print(max(2,10,3,14,4,28,7)) # Returns the largest of given arguments or items in an iterable ## 28 print(min(9,2,10,3,14,4,28,7)) # Returns the smallest of the given arguments or items in an) iterable ## 2 print(pow(3,4)) # Raises a number to a power ## 81 print(round(3.1415962,3)) # Rounds a floating-point value ## 3.142 print(sum([2,3,4,5,6])) ## 20 import math # Import math package/module from Standard Library print(math.sqrt(16)) # square root function ## 4.0 print(math.exp(0)) # exponentiation function (powers of e) ## 1.0 print(math.log10(5)) # base 10 logarithm ## 0.6989700043360189 print(math.log(5)) # natural logarithm ## 1.6094379124341003 I suggest, choosing your favorite R introduction and work through it’s early examples using both R and Python - a good chance to try out Jupyter SOS kernel. It will also create a record of the basics of R and python side-by-side that you can refer back to. A full list of the built-in (as opposed to Standard Library Funtions) is displayed, from the python documentation, below. 5.2.0.1 Python Built-in Functions abs() dict() help() min() setattr() all() dir() hex() next() slice() any() divmod() id() object() sorted() ascii() enumerate() input() oct() staticmethod() bin() eval() int() open() str() bool() exec() isinstance() ord() sum() bytearray() filter() issubclass() pow() super() bytes() float() iter() print() tuple() callable() format() len() property() type() chr() frozenset() list() range() vars() classmethod() getattr() locals() repr() zip() compile() globals() map() reversed() import() complex() hasattr() max() round() delattr() hash() memoryview() set() R has a very large set of built-in functions available before the need to load any libraries arises. The R Language Reference provides a comprehensive background on built in fucntions as well as the rest of the language. So R is centered around the mandate of being a complete mathematical system, much like Matlab,(Octave or SciLab) which Python’s manadate is that of a full featured scripting and programming environment. However, calling standard library modules in python puts it quite easily and effectively on a even par with R. Going into more complex activites requires thar both load or import fucther libraries. Like Python’s Standard Library, the R Core Library shipping with the R install is described in the Full R Reference Manaual and covers a wide range of mathematical, statistical and programming solutions. We will go deeper into these and the other external Libraries and modules in the next chapter, covering functional programming in more detail. As well focused discussions on specific Data Science domains form a block of Chapters in Part II of the book. "],
["functional-programming-with-r-and-python.html", "6 Functional Programming with R and Python 6.1 Defining Functions 6.2 Calling and Using Functions 6.3 Writing Function Examples in R and Python 6.4 Using the Core R and Python Standard Libraries", " 6 Functional Programming with R and Python At this point we are ready to discuss the functional programming paradigm in R and Python. The other important paradigm, Object-Oriented, will be discussed in the following Chapter. In using python in a functional paradigm, a script is built as a series of functions. Data is passed through one of more functions (ie. as series of functions) to carry out steps of a larger task set. When data is passed to a function to carry out some task or analysis on a dataset results may then printed out directly, stored in memory or on disk, or displayed in graphical form by passing the analysis to another set of functions such as those of matplotlib for plotting etc. A function is a set of stored programmatic statements stored in an accessible form for reuse. The function is called in R or Python by simply inserting it by name in a statement to be executed by one of the interpreters. 6.1 Defining Functions A function is defined in a specific format for each language. 6.1.1 R Scripting doArea &lt;- function(radius){ area &lt;- pi * radius^2 } 6.1.2 Python Scripting import math def calcArea(radius): area = math.pi * radius**2 return area 6.2 Calling and Using Functions 6.2.1 R Scripting radius = 4 print(doArea(radius)) ## [1] 50.26548 x = doArea(4) + 100 print(x) ## [1] 150.2655 6.2.2 Python Scripting import math def calcArea(radius): area = math.pi * radius**2 return area print(calcArea(4)) ## 50.26548245743669 Let’s discuss the differences in how the functions were called to be used. COnsider first that the book is set-up as written in rMarkdown which is running in an instance of R. The memory of the code chunk and the underling R which rmarkdown is running are the same. In python terms, the namespace is the same. This is not the case with the python code chunks. We have to explicitly pass to (and retrieve from) the R namespace for it to be accessible to the python chunk, running in it’s on (python) namespace. As a result we had to redefine the function in the same namespace in which we were calling it. With R code chunks the R memory space is open throughout but the python chunks name space is closed each time the python chunk closes. This is a feature of how I am using the R environment to write this book, not of python per se. Further, recalling we are writing scripts, the print statements are required for both to display the result. We could have used the cat() function of course to display the R output as well. cat(x) # x is still in R memory here ## 150.2655 Note that the result number [1] is not printed with R using cat() or the python print() functions. There are more subtlies of memory management in calling one language from inside the other. These will come up below but for now knowing how things behave in the R/rMarkdown environment as above will cover our memory space issues. 6.3 Writing Function Examples in R and Python 6.3.0.1 Example 1 A Surveyor’s Function Lets write a function in R and Python to calculate the height of a tower knowing the angle of elevation at a given distance from the base. This would be something we might need when sighting through a surveyors transit. Given a distance from the base of 1000 meters, how high is a tower whose top was measured at an angle of 25 degrees at that distance. d = 1000 # distance in meters to base ad = 25 # angle in degrees # write a function to convert degrees to radians deg2rad = function(angledeg){ angledeg * (pi/180) } # write function to calcular height from angle in degrees ht = function(d, ad){ h = d*tan(deg2rad(ad)) } # now call and output function with distance d and angle ad in degrees cat(&quot;Tower Height in meters is: &quot;, ht(d, ad), &quot;\\n&quot;) ## Tower Height in meters is: 466.3077 So we have written 2 functions, one to convert degrees to radians, that is the expected measure of the angle going into ttigonometric functions of R. Then we wrote a function to accept degrees input and give the height in meters (the input distance units) The function definitions use the keyword ‘function, followed by zero or more arguments and then the code block of the function is set out by brace brackets’{ }’. The function is assigned to a name like a variable. Lets do it with python now, # set variables to problem givens d = 1000 # distance in meters to base ad = 25 # angle in degrees # write a function to convert degrees to radians def deg2rad(angledeg): import math return(angledeg * (math.pi/180)) # write function to calcular height from angle in degrees def ht(d, ad): import math return (d*math.tan(deg2rad(ad))) # now call and output function with distance d and angle ad in degrees print(&quot;The height in meters of the tower is :&quot;, ht(d, ad)) ## The height in meters of the tower is : 466.3076581549986 In the python declarations the definition starts with the keyword ‘def’ a name and zero or more arguments and there is a colon ‘:’ at the end of the first line. The code block of the function is also indented rather than set out by brace brakets ‘{ }’. The first line is the signature of the function. Both functions return a value, typically the last value in the calculation chain for R but as an explicitly called return for python. Note for the two python functions one has a space after return and the other doesn’t. This is because the bracket do not contain return parmeters but group the expression to be returned. Also as previously alluded to pi in R is a core CONSTANT but in python it is a CONSTANT in the math module which must be imported to use it. We could have just explicitly imported only pi at the start and referred to it directly by name as in R. # Python code print(pi) Gives an error: Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;C:\\Users\\medma\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpYlYLtl\\chunk-code-148c67392482.txt&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; print(pi) NameError: name &#39;pi&#39; is not defined from math import pi print(pi) ## 3.141592653589793 Once again you must know where to go to get some constants and functions with python which are built-in in R. Check out the math module in the standard python library3. 6.4 Using the Core R and Python Standard Libraries Core R distributions currently install with a base set of function packages. The Table in the Appendix 3 lists these. The python standard libraries contain alot of modules which can be imported. They are grouped in modules by functionality. The functions contained in the modules can be looked up in the Official Documentation online or referring to the Hellmann2 book. As done for the R base system in the Appendix, I also list the groups of python modules of the Standard Library in the Appendix 3 by kind as in the Python Documentation3, but generally including only occasional examples of the many functions each contain. Again a more exhaustive handling is available as indicated. 6.4.1 R Scripting 6.4.2 Python Scripting "],
